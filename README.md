# This repo is used to perform some EDA and visualizations on hotel bookings.
# In this dataset, each row represents a reservation.  Some reservations were cancelled, some weren't. There are two different hotels in this data.  Applying domain knowledges, a new KPI of 'Occupancy Rate' was created in order to compare the results for the hotels.  Some of the data was also cleaned based on logic observed.
